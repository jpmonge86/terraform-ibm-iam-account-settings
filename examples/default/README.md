# Default Example

An example using the module's default variable values to configure IBM account settings.
**NOTE:** This example will enforce only allowed IP addresses passed in the `allowed_ip_addresses` list variable. To ensure
someone running this example does not lock themselves out of their account, the default value in this example is set to
`"0.0.0.0/0"` to allowlist all IPs.
